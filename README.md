## FAQ

**Where is my data stored?**  
All data is stored locally in an SQLite database file (`dflow.db`).

**Can I use dflow with a team?**  
dflow is primarily designed for individual use, but flows and logs can be exported or shared.

**How do I reset or delete a flow?**  
Currently, youâ€™ll need to use database tools to manually remove flows.
